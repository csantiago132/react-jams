# React Jams

A Spotify-ish application built with React; a proof-of-concept to start integrating with Spotify and create a music player. 

> See the [demo here](http://bloc-jams-react-project.surge.sh/)

2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd react-jams`.
3. Run `yarn install` in order to install dependencies.
4. Run `yarn start` to start the application.
